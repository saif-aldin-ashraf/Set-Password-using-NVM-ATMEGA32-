## Project Description :-

## <The ⚡afe> 

🔒"Set-Password-using-NVM-ATMEGA32 (The Safe)"🔐.
With the utilization of Atmega32 microcontroller, NVM EEPROM driver, 4-bit mode LCD interface, keypad input, and a stepper motor, we've created a secure vault password system.

Key Features💫:
1-Set a password securely (saved in EEPROM).
2- To start the motor, you have a maximum of three tries to enter the correct password, after which it goes into lock mode.
3-Enhanced security through password encryption in EEPROM.

Drivers Used📑:
1-EEPROM driver
2-DIO driver
3-LCD driver (4Bit Mode)🖥
4-KEYPAD driver⌨
5-Stepper motor driver ⚙
